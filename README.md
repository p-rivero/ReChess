# ReChess: Chess Reinvented by You

ReChess is an intuitive and easy-to-use chess web app that allows you to create and play your own highly personalized chess variants. It's built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and uses a heavily modified version of the [Protochess engine](https://github.com/p-rivero/protochess-engine) for the game logic.

## Collaborating ‚ù§

### Cloning the Repository

This project uses the `protochess-engine` repo as a submodule. If you haven't cloned this repository with the `--recurse-submodules` option, you can run the following command to clone the submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

When pulling changes, I recommend using the `--recurse-submodules` option to make sure you also get the latest changes in the submodules, if any:

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

Make sure you also have `cargo`, `wasm-pack` and `rustup` installed. The first compilation of the engine might take a while.
